<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview

This project investigates the application of **K-Means Clustering** on financial market data. By categorizing stocks into distinct clusters based on their historical price movements, the system provides a data-driven approach to understanding market dynamics and constructing balanced investment portfolios.

Developed as a mini-project for the **Big Data Analytics & Computational Lab - I** curriculum, this implementation showcases the full data science pipeline: from data acquisition via Yahoo Finance to feature engineering (volatility/returns) and unsupervised model validation.

### Resources

> [!TIP]
> **Cluster Validation Best Practices**
>
> Use the **Elbow Method** to identify the optimal number of clusters by plotting Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS). Complement this with the **Silhouette Score** to validate cluster cohesion and separation for robust market segmentation.

- **Environment**: Virtual environment (venv) is highly recommended.

> [!WARNING]
> **Technical Dependencies & Data Variability**
>
> This system is built using **Python 3.8+** and **Scikit-Learn**. Stock market data is inherently volatile; results may vary based on the date range and ticker symbols selected. For stable execution and reproducible analysis, it is recommended to run this in an isolated virtual environment.

### 2. Setup & Deployment
1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Amey-Thakur/OPTIMIZING-STOCK-TRADING-STRATEGY-WITH-K-MEANS-CLUSTERING.git
    cd OPTIMIZING-STOCK-TRADING-STRATEGY-WITH-K-MEANS-CLUSTERING
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. Launch Application
